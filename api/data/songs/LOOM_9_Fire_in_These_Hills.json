        "And I know you think about everything that I did wrong, but I do, too\nStayin' up these nights, drinkin' everything, I got nothing without you\nI fear I might die alone\nI fear I might knock and no one's home\nStayin' up these nights, thinkin' everything that I did wrong to you",
        "I don't think that I'm strong enough\nI'm never enough",
        "'Cause there's fire in these hills\nAnd I think I've lost the will\nThe more we try, the more we fail\nBut after everything, you're here with me still\n'Cause there's fire in these hills\nAnd I think I've lost my will\nThe more we try, the more we fail\nBut after everything, you're here with me still",
        "Gonna turn this car around, open up a sit-down, tell you all the truth\nGonna fade myself out, talkin' myself down, lightin' up this fuse\nI fear I might wreck this home\nI fear I might knock and no one comes\nAnd I know you think about everything that I did wrong, but I do, too",

        "I'm so tired, can I please come home?\nI've run so far, can I, can I come home?\nI'm so tired, can I please come home?\nI've run so far, can I, can I come home?\nI'm so tired, can I please come home?\nI've run so far, can I, can I come home?",
