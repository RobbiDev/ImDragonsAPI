        "Woke up to the phone, wanna see your name\nTakin' some space, and I'm all to blame, alright\nAlright, alright\nUsed to pick you up every afternoon\nSpin you around every single room, alright\nAlright, alright",
        "How can it feel so good and be so bad?\nMisunderstood, and I can't take it back now\nJust like I knew you would, you turn your back\nAnd now we're here, and it fades to black",
        "Tell me I'm right, tell me I'm wrong\nBut you know I've been here all along\nIn your corner\nIn your corner\nStayin' up late, playin' our song\nYou know I've been here all along\nIn your corner\nIn your corner",
        "Ayy, ayy, yeah (Hold on, hold on)\n(Keep your hands up)\nAyy, yeah (Hold on, hold on; alright, alright)\n(Keep your hands up)",
        "Gonna search this room 'til I find a pill\nGonna rinsе this down, everything I feel, alright\nTonight, alright\nGonna burn this down, evеry sober day\nGonna blow this out, throw it all away, alright\nAlright, alright",
