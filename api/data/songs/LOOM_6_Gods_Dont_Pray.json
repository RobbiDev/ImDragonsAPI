        "No turnin' back, you know I've seen too much\nMy venom went and turned to rage\nYeah, paint it black, don't need a Midas touch\nMy sentiment is center page",
        "'Cause I've come, I've conquered, water's parted\nNow I'm here to stay\nI've won, I've lost, I've paid the cost\nAnd I'll never break\nUntil doomsday",
        "We ain't never comin' downstairs\nGods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay\nSave it for somebody that cares\nGods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay\nLove me, hate me and make me ugly\nBreak me and shame me\nYou should see the view up here\nGods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay",
        "A loaded gun up on a moonlit night\nYou wanna be a man that's made\nYou've done your wrongs, and now you feel so right\nYou're sweatin', but you're in the shade",
        "'Cause I've come, I've conquered, water's parted\nNow I'm here to stay\nI've won, I've lost, I've paid that cost\nAnd I'll never break, oh",
        "We ain't never comin' downstairs\nGods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay\nSave it for somebody that cares\nGods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay\nLove me, hate me and make me ugly\nBreak me and shame me\nYou should see the view up here\nGods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay",
        "Wake me when the circus passes under\nWake me when the pirates stop the plunder\nFortune is unfortunately volatile\nTrust me that the future's looking futile (Gods don't pray)",
        "We ain't never comin' downstairs\nGods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay\nSave it for somebody that cares\nGods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay\nLove me, hate me and make me ugly\nBreak me and shame me\nYou should see the view up here\nGods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay",
        "Gods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay\nGods don't pray, Gods don't pray, -ay"
