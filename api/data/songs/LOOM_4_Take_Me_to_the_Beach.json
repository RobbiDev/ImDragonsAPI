        "People-pleasin' planet\nGot a million people sayin' how to plan it\nI can no longer stand it\nGonna spend my days tellin' them to can it\nEach and to their own\nGot a salesman ringin' my phone\nTell me where to go\nNo, I don't wanna hear the down low",
        "I owe, oh-oh-oh\nNothin', not a penny, never wanna hear you preach\nNo, oh-oh-oh",
        "Take-take-take-take) Take me to the beach\nAh-ah-ah, you could have the mountains\nAh-ah-ah, you take the snow\nAh-ah-ah, it's way too cold\nMy heart is cold enough\nAh-ah-ah, push comes to shove\nAh-ah-ah, you could have the mountains\nAh-ah-ah, I'll take the beach",
        "If you want it, com–µ and get it\nGot a million people tellin' me they're with it\nAnd they got me at my limit\nAnd I'm tellin' you I never spare a minute\nIf you wanna keep on livin'\nFor the sucker that is tellin' you your limit\nGotta find out it's a gimmick\nCan't nobody tell you how to live it",
        "I owe, oh-oh-oh\nNothin', not a penny, never walkin' on a leash\nNo, oh-oh-oh",
        "Take-take-take-take) Take me to the beach\nAh-ah-ah, you could have the mountains\nAh-ah-ah, you take the snow\nAh-ah-ah, it's way too cold\nMy heart is cold enough\nAh-ah-ah, push comes to shove\nAh-ah-ah, you could have the mountains\nAh-ah-ah, I'll take the beach",
        "I'm better off alone\nLike a rollin' stone\nTurnin' off my phone\nNo one bringin' me down, down, down, down\nJust give me some space\nThat sun in my face\nAnd the days go on, and on, and on, and on (T-A-K-E, T-A-K-E)",
        "T-A-K-E, take me to the beach (Oh)\nAh-ah-ah, you could have the mountains (Have the mountains)\nAh-ah-ah, you take the snow\nAh-ah-ah, it's way too cold (It's way too cold)\nMy heart is cold enough (Oh)\nAh-ah-ah, push comes to shove\nAh-ah-ah, you could have the mountains\nAh-ah-ah, I'll take the beach (I'll take the)\nTake me to the (I'll take the)",
        "I don't have no friends, ask anyone (Ahh)\nGot me 'til the end, my favorite one (Take me to the beach; don't, I'll take the)\nI don't have no friends, ask anyone (Ask anyone)\nGot me 'til the end, my favorite one (Take me to the beach)"
