        "Wheels up when I'm off the ground, I'm\nNowhere, but I'm all around\nI'm spinnin-in-in', watch me now, I'm\nSpinnin-in-in' (Spinnin-in-in')\nBig man when a wall between us\nBig man gonna break to pieces\nSpinnin-in-in', can't believe it\nSpinnin-in-in' (Spinnin-in-in')",
        "Uh, turn around, turn it up\nTalk a bit, zip it up\nLock you in, and close it up\nYup",
        "Everybody's comin' for you, wake up\nEverybody's comin', wake up\nBodies droppin' everywhere, I'm waist up\nEverybody's comin', wake up",
        "Some days, I'm a cha-chameleon\nSwitch it up when I crawl the ceilin'\nFlip it upside down, I'm wheelin'\nDealin-in-in' (Dealin-in-in')\nEvery single one of you is comin' to my mind\nBring 'em all together, can you stack 'em in a line?\nJealousy is gonna be your failure, not mine\nWinnin-in-in' (Winnin-in-in')",
        "Uh, turn around, turn it up\nTalk a bit, zip it up\nLock you in, and close it up (Up, up, up, up)\nOh!",
        "Everybody's comin' for you, wake up (Wake up)\nEverybody's comin', wake up\nBodies droppin' everywhere, I'm waist up (Waist up)\nEverybody's comin', wake up",
        "Everybody's comin', wake up",
        "Got a case of the take-or-leave-it\nGive an inch and I'm bound to seize it\nTake a chainsaw out and feed it\nRing-dingin-in-in' (Ring-dingin-in-in')\nCome alive when you don't believe it\nWrite me off, and I'd love to read it\nSpit your words, and I'll watch you eat it\nDiggin-in-in' (Diggin-in-in')\nOh!",
        "Everybody's comin' for you, wake up (Wake up)\nEverybody's comin', wake up\nBodies droppin' everywhere, I'm waist up (Waist up)\nEverybody's comin', wake up",
        "Everybody's comin', wake up",
        "What are you to do?\nWhen they come for you\nWinners hate to lose"
