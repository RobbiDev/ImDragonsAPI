        "What could ever go wrong?\nSing your favorite song\nShe could come along\nOh yeah, yeah (Oh yeah, yeah)\nWhat could ever go wrong?\nSummer's never too long\nOur love's too strong\nOh yeah, yeah (Oh yeah, yeah)",
        "Anyway, it's nice to meet ya\nAnyway, it's nice to meet ya\nAnyway, it's nice to meet ya\nAnyway, it's nice to meet ya",
        "I was buyin' you those flowers\nI was listenin' for hours\nI was shuttin' up those doubters, ayy, yeah\nShe was jealous of our relationship\nShe hated that we were making it\nShe's smilin', but she fakin' it, yeah, yeah",
        "Prayin' that we make it through the weekend\nWind is in the sail, but we are sinkin'\nHammerin' a nail, and now we're leakin'\nAyy, yeah, yeah (Oh yeah, yeah)\nPaintin' on the wall is something freaky\nShe been throwin' punches like a T.K.O.\nKnockin' on the door and bein' sneaky\nGet away, yeah (Oh yeah, yeah)",
        "Anyway, it's nice to meet ya (Nice to meet ya)\nAnyway, it's nice to meet ya (It's nice to meet)\nAnyway, it's nice to meet ya (I hope to see ya)\nAnyway, it's nice to meet ya",
        "Anyway, it's nice to meet ya\nShe could be a Mona Lisa, should've seen her",
        "I hope we meet again, oh\nHey, it's nice to meet\nI hope we meet again, oh (True believer)\nAnyway, it's nice to meet ya\nI hope we meet again, oh (It's nice to meet ya; to meet again; I hope to see ya)\nI hope we meet again, oh (True believer; to meet again)\nAnyway, it's nice to meet ya"
