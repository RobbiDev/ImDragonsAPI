        "I could do this with my eyes closed",
        "I'm back from the dead, from the back of my head\nBeen gone and facin' horrors that should never be said\nThe wrath and the grit from the pit of despair\nBeen takin' every whip and word, I've never been spared",
        "They say tomorrow's never promised, honest\nThey say that angels are among us",
        "Lock me up in a maze (Oh)\nTurn out, turn out the lights (Oh, oh, oh-oh)\nI was born, I was raised for this (Oh)\nTurn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)\nLock me up inside a cage\nJust throw away the key, don't worry 'bout me\nI was drivin' in my car, throwin' up my hands, put it in coast",
        "I could do this with my eyes closed\nTurn out, turn out the lights\nI could do this with my eyes closed\nTurn out, turn out the lights\nI could do this with my eyes closed",
        "Less medications, less manifestations\nMantras, meditation, throw it all away\nAll the places I've been, all the blood that I've bled\nI've been broken down and beat up but I still get ahead\nAll the faceless embraces and the tasteless two faces\nKilled and resurrected 'cause I'll never be dead",
        "They say tomorrow's never promised, honest\nYeah, they say piranhas are among us",
        "Lock me up in a maze (Oh)\nTurn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh)\nI was born, I was raised for this (Oh)\nTurn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)\nLock me up inside a cage\nJust throw away the key, don't worry 'bout me\nI was drivin' in my car, throwin' up my hands, put it in coast",
        "I could do this with my eyes closed\nTurn out, turn out the lights\nI could do this with my eyes closed\nTurn out, turn out the lights\nI could, I could do this with my eyesâ€”",
        "And when the day broke, buried in violence\nSomethin' made my mind up\nI will spend these days as an island\nAlone and far away",
        "Lock me up in a maze (Oh, maze)\nTurn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)\nI was born, I was raised for this (Oh)\nTurn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh, turn out the lights)\nLock me up inside a cage (Oh)\nJust throw away the key, don't worry 'bout me\nI was drivin' in my car, throwin' up my hands, put it in coast",
        "I could do this with my eyes closed (Oh)\nTurn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh)\nI could do this with my eyes closed (Oh)\nTurn out, turn out the lights (Oh-oh, oh)\nI could, I could do this with my eyes closed\nTurn out, turn out the lights\nI could do this with my eyes closed\nTurn out, turn out the lights\nI could, I could do this with my eyes closed"
