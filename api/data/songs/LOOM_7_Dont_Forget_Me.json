        "After the party and people all fade\nThat's when I miss you the most\nTry to forget you, but can't find the way\nGuess that's just life, I suppose",
        "But I miss you when you're gone\nAnd I know that life moves on\nBut I can't just replace you with this much regret\nPlease, don't forget about me",
        "Just yet, don't forget me\nDon't forget me\nJust yet, don't forget me\nDon't forget me",
        "Remember when all that we had was your car?\nCounting our quarters each night\nEvery day wanderin' towards our North Star\nGuess we got lost in the light",
        "But I miss you when you're gone\nSo I wrote you one last song\nBut I can't just replace you with this much regret\nPlease, don't forget about me",
        "Just yet, don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (-get me)\nDon't forget me\nJust yet, don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (Promise me)\nDon't forget me",
        "Just yet\nEven when it's gone\nCan we just hold on?",
        "After the years and the thousands of tears\nSay it 'til nothin' is left\nI won't forget you\nI won't forget you",
        "So don't for- (Don't for-) -get me (-get me)\nDon't forget me (Don't forget)\nDon't for- (Don't for-) -get me (Promise me)\nDon't forget me\n(Just yet) Askin' you (Don't for-), beggin' you (-get me)\nPromise me, ooh (Don't forget me)\n(Just yet) Askin' you (Don't for-), beggin' you (-get me)\nPromise me, ooh (Don't forget me)",
