        "We could be strangers in the night\nWe could be passing in the shadows\nWe couldn't be closer if we tried\nWhen we're caught in the headlights\nWe could be faces in the crowd\nWe could be passin' in the shadows\nLovin' the risk of bein' found\nWhen we're caught in the headlights",
        "Dangerous\nYour love is always dangerous\nAnd now I'm lost in us\nWe're livin' in a lie of trust",
        "I don't know why\nBut I guess it's got somethin' to do with you\nTo do with you\nI don't know why\nBut I guess it's got somethin' to do with you\nTo do with you",
        "I was a vacant alibi\nTrading the truth in for a lie, oh\nWe were the essence of desire\nAnd we're caught in the headlights",
        "Dangerous\nYour love is always dangerous\nAnd now I'm lost in us\nWe're livin' in a lie of trust",
        "I don't know why\nBut I guess it's got somethin' to do with you\nTo do with you\nI don't know why\nBut I guess it's got somethin' to do with you\nTo do with you (I don't know, ah)\nI don't know why\nBut I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (I don't know)\nTo do with you (I don't know, ah)\nI don't know why\nBut I guess it's got somethin' to do with you\nTo do with you",
        "Tell me that you love me\nTell me that you love me\nTell me that you love me\nTell me that you love me\nTell me that you love me\nDangerous\nTell me that you love me\nTell me that you love me\nYour love is always dangerous\nTell me that you love me",
        "I don't know why",
        "I don't know why (Ah)\nBut I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (I don't know)\nTo do with you (I don't know, ah)\nI don't know why\nBut I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (To do with you)\nTo do with you (I don't know, ah)\nI don't know why\nBut I guess it's got somethin' to do with you (To do with you) (I don't know)\nTo do with you (I don't know, ah)\nI don't know why\nBut I guess it's got somethin' to do with you\nTo do with you"
